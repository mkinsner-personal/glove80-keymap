# Custom Colemak keymap for the Glove80 keyboard

I'm currently using a [MoErgo Glove80 keyboard](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) with the following custom keymap:

The primary layer is Colemak layout.

This keymap is derived from [Sunaku's keymap work](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps), although I've disabled the home row mods because I don't like response lag when using modifiers.  Many layers have been removed and remaining layers modified.

## Primary (Colemak) layer:
