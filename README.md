# Custom keymap for the Glove80 keyboard

I'm currently using a [MoErgo Glove80 keyboard](https://www.moergo.com/collections/glove80-keyboards) with the following custom keymap:

This keymap is derived from [Sunaku's keymap work](https://github.com/sunaku/glove80-keymaps), although I've currently disabled the home row mods and some of the layers, in addition to modifying remaining layers.
